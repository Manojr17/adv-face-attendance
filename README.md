**Face Recognition Based Attendance System**:


This project is a face recognition-based attendance system that uses OpenCV and Python. The system uses a camera to capture images of individuals and then compares them with the images in the database to mark attendance.

**Installation**

      1)Clone the repository to your local machine

      2)Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.

   3)Download the dlib models from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12It2jeNQOxwStBxtagL1vvIJokoz-DL4?usp=sharing and place the data folder inside the repo

IMPORTANT NOTES:

Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit that contains machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software to solve real-world problems.
It is widely used in Python via its Python bindings, especially for Computer Vision, Face Recognition, and Object Detection tasks.

⚠️ Note: Dlib may require CMake and Boost libraries. You may need Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows( Install Visual Studio Installer 2017)

 While working in Pycharm verify that you are using Python version 3.8,3.9,3.10 because these are the version that used to support dlib.
 In these ,versions only dlib supportive package are defaultly installed and it is easy to use.
 
 Why is Dlib Popular for Face Recognition?
 
      i)High accuracy in face recognition.

      ii)Pre-trained models available (like shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat and dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat).

      iii)Can generate unique face embeddings (128D vectors) for matching.


      iv)Works offline — no need for cloud APIs.
